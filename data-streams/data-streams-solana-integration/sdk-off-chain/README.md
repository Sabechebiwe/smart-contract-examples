## Program Clients

These clients can be pulled into other programs to interact with the on-chain programs

- [verifier](src/verifier_client.rs) - Lightweight client just for verifying reports with the verifier program.
- [verifier_admin_client](src/verifier_admin_client.rs) - Admin client for managing the verifier program and accounts.
- [access_controller](src/access_controller_client.rs) - Admin client for managing the access controller program and
  accounts.
